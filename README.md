# CSIT314_Project

In this project, we are tasked to design and develop a covid-19 software application that supports contact 
tracing, vaccine certification, alerting and generating reports. The system serves as a platform for different 
stakeholders/users including the public, businesses and health staff and organisations. Each of them may have 
different interaction points to the system.
